        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
          Outside the space-warp chamber,
          Rizal's great green sun had already
          set. Thick olive dusk eddied through
          the interplanetary transit center. I
          swore under my breath and slammed
          shut the warp-hatch switch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locking bars whispered back. The
          hatch revolved on its axis, slow as
          an asteroid eroding. I threw another
          quick glance at my chrono. It still
          read the same as before: six Earth
          hours more… six hours to ferret out
          the truth or be forever
          reconditioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          —Six hours, that is, if Controller
          Alfred Kruze didn't cut it shorter.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if he did, Rizal might very well
          change status. Today, it was billed
          as the FedGov's outermost bastion
          against the Kel. Tomorrow, it could
          prove man's fatal flaw, the Achilles
          heel in our whole system of
          defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In which case—
        </p>
        <p>
          Involuntarily, I shivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Agent Traynor—?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice came from the shadows. A
          dull, phlegmatic, tranquilized,
          conditioned voice. I stopped short;
          turned fast. “Who's asking?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The man shrugged stolidly, not even
          picking up my tension. “I'm a port
          rep, Agent Traynor. Port rep second,
          that is—”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          “So who told you to come out here?
          Who said you should meet me?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh…” A pause. “Well, you see,
          there's this sigman, Agent Traynor.
          Up in the Interworld Communications
          section. He had a regular 7-D
          clearance report that a FedGov
          Security investigation agent was
          warping in—you have to file a 7-D on
          all warpings, you know, Agent
          Traynor, on account of restrictives.
          So—well, the rep first was out to
          eat, so I just notified Rizal
          Security, just a routine report, and
          the unit controller there, an Agent
          Gaylord, he said for me to meet you,
          and—”
        </p>
        <p>
          I bit down hard and shifted my
          weight, both at once, wondering if a
          broken jaw would interfere with the
          work of a port rep second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only then, all at once, I caught the
          unmistakable whish of a grav-car
          sweeping in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lights hit us almost in the same
          instant. Two seconds later a man who
          said he was Agent Gaylord was
          jumping down and locking wrists with
          me in Rizal's traditional greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even that wrist-lock set my teeth on
          edge. It was too solid, too stolid,
          too thorough a job of conditioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or was it maybe, just a trifle
          over-done?
